## Adding Exploits/Methods Rules:
### Add Game Exploits:
- We do not want the exploit to be loaded from a loadstring or from external links. 
- We don't want the script you're going to add to be obfuscated, this is strictly prohibited. 

### Add Roblox System Methods:
- We want tested, working methods. 
- The routes should be about Roblox, not the games in it.

## CopyRight Rules (Game Exploits/Executors only):
## Exploit/Executor CopyRights:
- If the exploit/executor is yours or the one you will add has License in the last line when you create yourexploit.md put ©
```
Created by [YourName] [2025] ©
```
- If your exploit/executor is open source and does not have a license, put this logo ® like this: 
```
Created by [YourName] [2025] ®
```

- If your exploit/executor is open source and has a license, put ©® it together like this: 
```
Created by [YourName] [2025] ©®
```

or you can put not your own executor/exploit but you need to do more researches about what you will do and are you sure about that
